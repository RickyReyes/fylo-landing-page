## My process

- I began by comparing the mobile and desktop designs, and while writing the semantic HTML5 markup I planned ahead in regards to media queries and flex containers.
- I styled the page using CSS with careful attention.
- I added some vanilla JavaScript for a simple email validation.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I learned how to align elements using display: flex, align-items: center, and justify-content: center.
- I learned how to change the opacity of one element when the user hovers over some other element. (see green arrow)

### Continued development

In the future, I will use more descriptive and understandable class names for my CSS.
