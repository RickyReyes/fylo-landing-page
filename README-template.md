## My process

First, I wrote the HTML while looking at both the mobile and desktop designs.
- I started with mobile, but planned ahead for the desktop design, especially for any Flexbox or CSS Grid that I'd be using.

Next, I layed out all the sections on the page using either Flexbox or Grid, deciding how the transition from mobile to desktop should look.

Finally, I added some JavaScript for the email validations, and hover events on CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This project helped me get more comfortable using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
